# Welcome to Portfolio Blog Website

### This portfolio blog website is created with some of the latest and greatest technologies to create a robust and user-friendly website.

</br>

### **Frontend Technology :**

</br>

-   #### Next.js: With [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), we are able to provide our users with fast-loading pages and a seamless browsing experience.
-   #### TypeScript: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ensures that our code is easy to read, maintain, and debug.

-   #### React Query: [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) makes it easy for us to handle server state management and caching, while [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) enables us to make API calls and fetch data from our database.

-   #### Tailwind CSS: I have also utilized [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Flowbite](https://flowbite-react.com/) to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces, making our website easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing.

-   #### React Hook Form: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) is a powerful library that allows you to easily build and validate forms in React. We validate the form with [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) schema validation library.

-   #### Next Themes: We managed the website theme dark/light using Next Themes. Full website is design according to both dark and light theme.

-   #### Toastify: We used [React-Toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) to add notifications on this website.

</br>

### **Backend Technology :**

</br>

-   #### Next connect: We manage our API routes using Next Connect. With [Next Connect](https://github.com/hoangvvo/next-connect), we can easily add new functionality to your application's server, without having to write low-level code or deal with complex configurations.

-   #### Mongoose: With [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), you create schemas for our data, define validation rules, and perform CRUD operations on our [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.

-   #### Multer: For uploading images, we used [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) middleware package and used [Jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) for optimizing image size.

-   #### JWT: For Authenticating and Authorization, we used [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) to save user data in cookies.

-   #### Nodemailer: With [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/), we can easily send website Contact form & Booking Form data from our Portfolio application using a variety of email services, including SMTP, SendGrid, and Gmail.

</br>

### **Website Feature & API Functionality :**

</br>

### **# Authentication & Authorization:**

</br>

#### From the website admin panel admin can create different kind of user role like Admin or User using new email and Password. We also manage Website Frontend and API routes protected so that normal user or visitor can't get all the access.

</br>

#### For user authentication we used JWT token and cookies to manage user authentication. Logged in user can update his/her information from the website dashboard.

</br>

### **# Blog Functonality**

</br>

-   #### **Create Blog:** With React Hook Form and React Draft Editor validation, admin can easily create blog posts with a rich text editor.

-   #### **Update Blog:** If a user wants to make changes to a blog post, There have an edit button that opens the post in the same form used to create the post, allowing the user to make changes and save the updated post.
-   #### **Trash Blog:** Once a blog post has been created, uadmin can trash the post if they no longer want it to be visible on the site.
-   #### **Restore Blog:** If a admin has accidentally deleted a blog post, admin can restore the post by clicking "Restore" button to each post in the trash page.
-   #### **Deleted Blog:** If a admin wants to permanently delete a post, there have a "Delete" button that permanently removes the post from the database.

-   #### **Create Category:** To organize blog posts, we provide admins with the ability to create categories. In "Category" Page have a form to add a new category.

-   #### **Update Category:** If a admin wants to make changes to a category, that can be done also clicking on "Edit" button from the "Category" Page.

-   #### **Delete Category:** Admin can also delete the category permanently. All the post of that deleted category will be trasnfer into **"Uncategorized"** category.
